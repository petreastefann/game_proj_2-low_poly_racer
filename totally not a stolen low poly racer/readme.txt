version 1.0 first and final. of course this was stolen, im romanian duh. a failed project nonetheless.
wanted to add more cars with different physics, like an f1 car, a sports one and a levitating frying pan and also more maps
but the budget was too low for the developement team.
have fun.


move with wasd or arrow keys.
if you get flipped press 'r' to rotate exactly 180 degrees.(dont ask me why it doesnt have an animation or something).
if you get stuck or fly off the map, alt f4.
the checkpoints are on every corner so dont cheat.
